      "question": "A material shows a high value of H/E. This primarily indicates:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High plastic deformation",
        "b": "High elastic recovery",
        "c": "High thermal conductivity",
        "d": "High surface roughness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: High plastic deformation corresponds to low H/E.</a>",
        "b": "<a href='www.google.com'>Correct: High H/E indicates greater elastic recovery and resistance to crack initiation.</a>",
        "c": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: H/E is unrelated to thermal properties.</a>",
        "d": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: H/E has no relation to surface roughness.</a>"

      "question": "If the unloading stiffness S increases while all other parameters remain constant, the calculated modulus will:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decrease",
        "b": "Increase",
        "c": "Remain unchanged",
        "d": "Become zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Higher stiffness means higher modulus.</a>",
        "b": "<a href='www.google.com'>Correct: E<sub>r</sub> ∝ S. Higher stiffness corresponds to higher elastic modulus, meaning the material is stiffer and offers greater resistance to elastic deformation.</a>",
        "c": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Stiffness directly influences modulus.</a>",
        "d": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Modulus cannot become zero when there is measurable stiffness.</a>"

      "question": "Two materials have the same hardness. Material A has lower modulus than Material B. Which will likely show better wear resistance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Material A",
        "b": "Material B",
        "c": "Both same",
        "d": "Cannot be predicted"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "<a href='www.google.com'>Correct: Lower modulus indicates higher H/E and H³/E². Material A will exhibit greater elastic recovery and smaller plastic zones, leading to improved wear resistance.</a>",
        "b": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Higher modulus leads to lower elastic recovery, making it more prone to wear.</a>",
        "c": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Their wear resistance will differ based on modulus.</a>",
        "d": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Prediction is possible from H/E and H³/E² ratios.</a>"

      "question": "Which parameter is most directly related to resistance against plastic ploughing during sliding wear?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Elastic modulus E",
        "b": "Maximum load Pmax",
        "c": "Contact depth hc",
        "d": "H³/E²"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Modulus alone does not determine ploughing resistance.</a>",
        "b": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Load is only an experimental input, not a material property.</a>",
        "c": "<a href='www.google.com'>Incorrect: Contact depth is an indentation geometry parameter.</a>",
        "d": "<a href='www.google.com'>Correct: H³/E² quantifies resistance to plastic deformation and plastic zone size. Higher values reduce ploughing and debris formation, directly lowering wear.</a>"
